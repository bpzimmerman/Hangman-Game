read word from array or external file?
- put word into its own array with each character a separate element (wordArray)
- create another array the same length as the wordArray, but filled with placeholder characters (guessArray)
  * replace the correct placeholder in the guessArray with any spaces or other special characters

display the guessArray on the page

check the chances variable
- if it =0
  * increment losses
  * update page display
  * alert player "Game Over"
- if it >0
  * check the index of "_" in guessArray
    > if it =-1
      ~ increment wins
      ~ update page display
      ~ alert player "Winner"
    > if it !=-1, continue

read the players guess
- force all lower case

check players guess against:
- alphabetArray (verify that the guess is a letter)
  * if guess is not in array, alert player that guess is not allowed
  * otherwise continue
- usedArray (verify that the guess has not been used before)
  * if guess is in array, alert player that the guess has already been used
  * otherwise
    > put the guess in the usedArray
    > display on page
    > continue
- wordArray (check if the guess is part of the chosen word)
  * if guess is in array
    > retrieve the index(s) of the guess
    > update the guessArray by putting the guess in the correct position(s)
    > update the page display with the guess in the correct position(s)
  * otherwise
    > decrement the chances variable
    > update the page display with the new value for remaining allowable misses
